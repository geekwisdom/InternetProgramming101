# Internet Programming 101

This is the GITHUB project for the video 'Internet Programming 101.
[INTERNET PROGRAMMING 101](https://archive.org/details/INTERNETPROGRAMMING101)

The examples here cover listing1.c to listing6.c to describe a VERY SIMPLE web server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These samples are for educatinal purposes only!. They are not meant to be used in a LIVE PRODUCTION enviornment for any reason.

### Prerequisites

To use this examples yo uwill need a working C Compiler. The examples used here use the GCC (GNU C) compiler and basic build tools.
Setting these up vary depending upon your choosen OS.  For Debian/Ubuntu based systems you can issue the command

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Compiling

Compile each listing with the gcc command. For example to compile the basic 'Hello World' given in listing1.c

```
gcc listing1.c
```

If you want to change the name of the default binary output (ie: something other than './a.out'

```
gcc listing1.c -o listing1
```

## Running the sample

Once compiled, simply run the program to see the output

Eg:

```
./a.out
```

Programs should compile without any additional pre-requisies. Enjoy !
